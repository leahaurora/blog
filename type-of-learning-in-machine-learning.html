<h1>Types of Learning in Machine Learning<h1>
<p>Machine Learning is an extensive field of technology that focuses on building intelligent machine systems that can interpret data to make smart & precise decisions without any human intervention. It has several related ideas & techniques that you need to master as a Machine Learning programmer. This blog will disclose different types of Machine Learning based on fields of study, techniques, etc. Letâ€™s familiarize you with various Machine Learning types.<p>    

Fields of study in Machine Learning based on Learning Problems
Mainly, there are three Machine Learning problems, namely:

Supervised Learning- In supervised learning, we train or teach the machines to use labeled data already tagged with the correct answer. The machine gets a new set of data so that the supervised algorithm analyzes & evaluates the training data to produce a correct outcome from the labeled data. Supervised learning is further classified into two forms; Classification & Regression. 
Unsupervised Learning- The unsupervised learning mainly deals with unlabeled data. It is one of the machine learning techniques wherein the users do not need to supervise the model. It enables the model to work on its own, discover data and patterns that were previously undetected. Unsupervised learning has two main problems, including Density Estimations & Unsupervised Clustering. 
Reinforcement Learning- Reinforcement learning is employed by various machines & software to find the best possible path in a particular situation. It differs from the supervised learning in a way that in the supervised learning model, a correct answer is labeled, whereas in reinforcement learning, no answer is labeled, but the reinforcement agent itself decides what should be the action for a given task. It is bound to learn from experience.

Apart from the above subsets, there are several other types of Machine Learning based on the hybrid field of study, such as: 
Semi-Supervised Learning- It falls between supervised & unsupervised learning.  Semi-supervised learning is an ML approach containing a small part of labeled data & a large amount of unlabeled data during training. Its main objective is use of all of the available data efficiently, both labeled & unlabeled data.
Self-Supervised Learning- It is one of the unique types of Machine Learning problems that converts unsupervised to a supervised learning problem. The self-supervised or self-supervision model trains itself by availing a part of data to predict the other part & generate labels accurately. 
Multi-Instance Learning- MIL or Machine-Instance Learning is a subtype of supervised learning. MIL does not receive a set of instances that are labeled individually; instead, the learner receives a set of labeled bags that has many instances. 

To become a skilled Machine Learning programmer, you need to attain a solid understanding of all these Machine Learning types, from supervised, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
